## :page_with_curl: About

This is VOYAGE 2.0. It is a frontend-focus project that has comes from my original project [voyage](https://github.com/tinaaiscoding/voyage).

There will be some internal and external API used for this project as it has already been implemented from the original project.

I wanted to recreate this project because I left the first original voyage incomplete and I have never been fully satisfied with that project. Now a couple months down the track, I have fresher ideas and more direction with how I want to complete VOYAGE 2.0. 

My main focus will be on CSS and learning how to recreate the famous parallax scrolling effect for this project. I want to showcase and build on my frontend skills in this project.

There will be a full update to the README when the project is complete. But I wanted to just get on here to summarise the why I've decided to revamp this project ðŸ¤—
